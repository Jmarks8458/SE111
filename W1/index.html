        In freshmen year of high school I actually took an HTML course. This course was unfortunately <br>
        extremely outdated to the point where it would constantly refer to netscape navigator for more <br>
        information from a website that no longer exists. Eventually, after about a year, we managed <br> 
        to <b>finally</b> get an HTML 5 book. The next week we were switched to online learning because <br>
        of the covid 19 pandemic and were unable to do the course because of it.
