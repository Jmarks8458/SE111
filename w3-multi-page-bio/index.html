        <p>
            I grew up in Massachusetts in the town of bourne. Bourne is the town situated right on the Cape Cod Canal. <br>
            I've also got family in Florida as well as Canada. In the past my father used to own a ranch in Colorado. <br>
            We had alpacas, horses, goats, a donkey, and even an <i>awesome</i> <strong>pig.</strong> She was <b>very</b> friendly and would <br>
            roll over for belly rubs like a dog. Despite the ranch being in the Colorado desert, it was actually quite nice. <br>
            With the cleanest, naturally filtered water in the ground pumped by wells, and the most ripe strawberries I've <br>
            ever had it was surprisingly pleasant for a land of <em>sage and sand</em>.
