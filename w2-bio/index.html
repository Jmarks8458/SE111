        <h2>Bio</h2>

        <p>
             I grew up in Massachusetts in the town of bourne. Bourne is the town situated right on the Cape Cod Canal. <br>
             I've also got family in Florida as well as Canada. In the past my father used to own a ranch in Colorado. <br>
             We had alpacas, horses, goats, a donkey, and even an <i>awesome</i> <strong>pig.</strong> She was <b>very</b> friendly and would <br>
             roll over for belly rubs like a dog. Despite the ranch being in the Colorado desert, it was actually quite nice. <br>
             With the cleanest, naturally filtered water in the ground pumped by wells, and the most ripe strawberries I've <br>
             ever had it was surprisingly pleasant for a land of <em>sage and sand</em>.

        <h2>Schooling</h2>

            Previously I've attended a couple schools including:
            <ol>
                <li>Sain Margaret's Regional School</li>
                <li>Bourne Middle School</li>
                <li>Upper Cape Cod Regional Technical School - High School</li>
            </ol>
        <p>
            Out of these my high school was by far the best, even if it did have a tendency to catch fire, (thanks Culinary shop).

                <li>Warhammer Model Building</li>
                <li>Video Games</li>
                <li>MTG</li>
            </ul>
        <p>
            The most prevalent of my hobbies which is Warhammer manages to manifest itself into really more of two hobbies. <br>
            Model building being the main one with a huge amount of support from the actual lore behind the models and the 40K universe.<br>
            40K is a huge universe with so much to cover, so typically I use Lexicanum to help with such a diverse galaxy of stories.<br>
